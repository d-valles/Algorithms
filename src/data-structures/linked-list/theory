*Main Idea*
A linked list is a collection of entities which are not sorted in sequential order.
Instead, each entity has a poninter to the next entity. Each node or entity, is composed of a data and reference to the next node in sequence.
The stucture allows for efficient insertion or removal of nodes from any position in the sequence.

*Main Operation*
- Prepend - add a node to the beginning of the list.
- Append - add a node to the end of the list.
- Delete - remove a node from the list.
- Delete Tail - remove the last node from the list.
- Delete Head - remove the first node of the list.
- find - find a node.

* Applications*
Is a good foundation for many othe data structures like queues, stacks and hash tables.
